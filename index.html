<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I live in the Seattle area with my wife and two kids. I work at the University of Washington, at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Contact me at siosonel -at- gm<span>a</span>il.com.</p>

<p>When I am not auditing and archiving research code, data, and documentation, I enjoy working on personal projects related to highly-auditable information systems, decentralized currency systems, and reputation systems. Lately I've been getting more involved in data visualization projects.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href='TraceEval/'>TraceEval</a>: an open accounting and reputation framework. I have prototyped various components such as <a href='http://tyaga.org/NPX'>NPX</a>, with a <a href='http://tyaga.org/mUI'>smartphone UI design</a> and an <a href='http://tyaga.org/NPX/mssg.php'>SMS-compatible API</a>. I have also drafted an <a href='http://tyaga.org/docs/IPP.pdf'>Internet-enabled payment protocol</a> 
	which is implemented in NPX.</li>
	<li><a href='http://edgarsioson.com/flora/'>Flora</a>: This is an agent-based simulation testbed for testing the potential impact of sociotechnical proposals on population well-being. There is a related paper published in <a href='http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/15/3/6.html'>JASSS</a>, which I presented at the <a href='http://www.irit.fr/essa-summer-school-2012/'>ESSA 2012 summer school.</a></li>
	<li>iDie: A mortality database visualization tool, to be released publicly in December 2012</li>
	<li>Mostly completed projects which I might blog about later: 
		<ul>
			<li>(work) Automated tool for auditing archive completeness. This tool mines text in code files to determine the relationship between data files and the code that inputs or outputs them. It provides a simple visualization of file dependencies, presented
			in a tree structure.</li>
			<li>(graduate paper) Survey of MultiModal Mobile Interfaces</li>
			 <li>(graduate paper) Survey of Methods for Determining Online Review helpfulness (lexical features were found to be a good predictor across applicable methods)</li>			
			 <li>(work) Statistical analysis of process chromatography performance and diagnostics, with simulation of underlying separation mechanics to explain observed trends</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
